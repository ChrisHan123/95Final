In the first part of the program, the doctors conduct a new discharge assessment protocol using innovative evidence-based tools to help them decide whether patients are ready to return to their usual place of residence or if it would be more advisable to transfer them to an intermediate or short-term care facility. As such, this program is set to replace the previous protocol concerning where patients should be discharged.\n","\n","2. The second part of the program includes a group of nurses, physiotherapists, and occupational therapists who visit patients at home or in the intermediate facility after discharge. The frequency of these visits is determined by an assessment conducted prior to discharge, averaging about five visits per patient. Among other things, the team's tasks include ensuring proper wound healing, checking medication compliance, coordinating with a general practitioner or the medical team at the intermediate facility, and assessing the patient's ability to perform basic daily activities such as navigating their environment, using the toilet, and showering. Furthermore, the specialised unit maintains regular telephone contact with patients to check on their well-being. Patients are also encouraged to reach out to the unit if they need any assistance.\n","\n","This pilot program has been very successful and it has been welcomed by all the stakeholders.

For example, for the given patient with specific feature values (age, number_diagnoses, los, and num_medications), the prediction value is 0.52, which is higher than the base value and gets transformed to a class \"1\" prediction.

In the plot, the 'los' feature has the largest bar, indicating that it has the most significant impact on the predictions. Following that, 'num_medications', 'num_medications', and 'num_lab_procedure' also have notable contributions to the random forest predictions. 'Age' is the least impactful variable among the five features, while the other variables seem to have negligible impact on the predictions.\n","\n","The results make sense, as longer hospital stays, more medications, more diagnostics, and more lab tests, as well as an increased age, are factors that can lead to a higher chance of readmission.\n","\n","Using both 'shap.force_plot' and 'shap.summary_plot' together can provide a comprehensive understanding of the random forest model's predictions and their explanations.
